Welcome to my webpage! I am a graduate student at North Carolina State University.

I am from India where I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Physics from Presidency University, Kolkata and a Master's degree from Indian Institute of Technology Madrs (IITM).

## Research

I am interested in studying core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) simulations and nucleosynthesis.

I work with [Prof. Carla Frohlich](https://physics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/cfrohli/) and [Prof. James Kneller](https://physics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/jpknelle/) at North Carolina State University.

### Project 1: CCSNe equation of state

I have studied how the dense matter equation of state affects the CCSNe explosion properties, the nucleosynthesis yields, and the remnant mass distribution in the universe. The paper is now published in ApJ [ApJ 929 43 (2022)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac4d20/pdf). 

### Project 2: Neutrino signals from CCSNe

I plan to study the neutrino signals from CCSNe events and also the effect of EOS and progenitor metallicity on neutrino oscillations in CCSNe and neutrino signals detected by the neutrino detectors. 

## Teaching 

I have been a teaching assistant for the following labs:
1. PY 209 Physics lab for Engineers (Electromagnetism laboratory)
2. PY 211 Non-calculus physics lab (Mechanics laboratory)
3. PY 251 Introduction to Scientific Computing (Python)

## Outreach
    
1. As Co-Organizer for Astronomy Outreach Events, North Carolina State University I have helped organize and coordinate public observing events around the Research Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, & Chapel Hill)
	
2. As an executive member of Women in Physics, North Carolina State University I have helped organize career talks.
