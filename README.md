Welcome to my webpage! I am a postdoctoral research fellow of the [Nuclear Physics from Multi-Messenger Mergers](https://np3m.org/) research hub. As an NP3M fellow, I am currently based in the University of New Hampshire with [Prof. Francois Foucart](https://sites.google.com/site/francoisfoucart) as the faculty host.

## Current Research
I am interested in understanding extreme astrophysical events like Core-Collapse Supernovae and Compact Object Mergers and their contribution to heavy element nucleosynthesis. I use numerical simulations to study the underlying physics of the dynamical objects. I am particularly interested in understanding the role of neutrinos and their oscillatory behavior. Neutrino Oscillation can have significant effect on the the hydrodynamics as well as the subsequent nucleosyntesis. As a part of the NP3M collaboration, my goal is to understand the effect of neutrino oscillation on r-proceess abundances.


## PhD Research

I have obtained my PhD from North carolina State University under the supervision of [Prof. Carla Frohlich](https://physics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/cfrohli/). My primary work has been in studying Core-Collapse Supernovae explosions and explosive nucleosynthesis. I have also collaborated with [Prof. James Kneller](https://physics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/jpknelle/) also at NC State to study Collective Neutrino Oscillation in Core-Collapse Supernova.

### Project 1: CCSNe equation of state

I have studied how the dense matter equation of state affects the CCSNe explosion properties, the nucleosynthesis yields, and the remnant mass distribution in the universe. The paper is now published in [ApJ 929 43 (2022)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac4d20/pdf). 

### Project 2: Neutrino signals from CCSNe

I plan to study the neutrino signals from CCSNe events and the effect of EOS and progenitor metallicity on neutrino oscillations in CCSNe and neutrino signals detected by the neutrino detectors. 

## Teaching 

I have been a teaching assistant for the following labs:
1. PY 209 Physics lab for Engineers (Electromagnetism laboratory)
2. PY 211 Non-calculus physics lab (Mechanics Laboratory)
3. PY 251 Introduction to Scientific Computing (Python)

## Outreach
    
1. As Co-Organizer for Astronomy Outreach Events, at North Carolina State University I have helped organize and coordinate public observing events around the Research Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, & Chapel Hill)
	
2. As an executive member of Women in Physics, at North Carolina State University I have helped organize career talks.
